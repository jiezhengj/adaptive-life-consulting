Runtime entry: [`../SKILL.md`](../SKILL.md). Persistence semantics: [`persistence.md`](persistence.md). Truth-maintenance semantics: [`truth-maintenance.md`](truth-maintenance.md). Evidence provenance: [`evidence-and-research.md`](evidence-and-research.md).


These are recommended default schemas. Host environments may implement equivalent structured state without literal Markdown/YAML files.

## 6. Evidence Record

Suggested structure inside `evidence.md`:

```markdown
### E-014

Type:
user-reported-fact

Claim:
User can only reliably protect one formal weekend session.

Source:
Direct user statement.

Observed:
2026-08-19

Scope:
recurring formal activities

Confidence:
high

Status:
active

Dependencies:
- used_by: conclusion-v1
```

Possible evidence types:

```text
user-reported-fact
subjective-experience
observed-behavior
documentary-record
external-authoritative
external-corroborated
external-weak
agent-inference
```

---

## 7. Hypothesis Record

```markdown
### H-014

Hypothesis:
User may persist better when absence creates real responsibility toward others.

Status:
active
# active | strengthened | downgraded | rejected | superseded

Supporting Evidence:
- E-020
- E-021

Contrary Evidence:
- E-033

Confidence:
medium

Scope:
recurring group commitments
```

---

## 8. Experiment Record

`experiments.md`

```markdown
### EXP-003

Question:
Will the user remain engaged during the passive phases of a full team session?

Hypotheses:
- H-011
- H-017

Procedure:
Attend one complete realistic team session.

Do Not Substitute:
Short batting-cage session.

Observe:
- pre-departure reluctance
- attention during waiting
- desire to retry after failure
- spontaneous research afterward
- 24–48 hour physical cost

Ask Provider:
- beginner progression
- schedule expectations
- real competition path

Update Rule:
If attention remains high and voluntary curiosity appears afterward, strengthen H-011.
If passive phases produce disengagement and avoidance, strengthen H-017.

Status:
pending
```

parent_case: 2026-09-01_move-to-japan
relation: child
related_cases:
  - 2026-09-03_job-offer

aliases:
  - japan-move
```

## 11. Persistence Restriction

Example:

```yaml
record_id: relationship-0017
status: restricted
reuse_scope:
  - current-case-only
reason: user_requested_no_cross_case_reuse
```

---

## 12. Confidence Vocabulary

Recommended qualitative vocabulary:

```text
high
medium
low
unknown
```

For factual status:

```text
confirmed
probable
tentative
unknown
```

Avoid fake numerical precision unless the problem genuinely supports it.
